To-Do List:
Lister: Sahar
Typer: Andrew
1) DES key part that repeats twice in both encrypt/decrypt
2) Goffman version of converting hex string key
3) RSA pyrcrypto version or import RSA? LET'S DECIDE!!
  - Check if the RSA version allows for decryption with a public key
  - if it does then use that over pyrcrypto
4) CFB and CBC for RSA for even more extra credit
5) CFB Encrypt needs to be fixed because of some things
6) Implement CFB Decrypt which is almost the same
7) CBC encrypt/decrypt
8) README
9) Fix the driver to take extra argument for CFB mode
10) Change the drivers/readme to implement
